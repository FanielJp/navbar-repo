Building  a Responsive Nav Bar using HTML, CSS, jav

I start added a blank HTML skeleton document html file with some basic element and meta tags like head, title , body etc ... 

I also created a CSS document file and imported it  as an  external file. 
In  my stylesheet  i've got some default style and the asterisks means apply this to everything in the document. I've margin: 0, padding: 0 and  so this is the  way that i get some defaults im my HTML skeleton .
